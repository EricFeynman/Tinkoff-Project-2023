# Analysis of User Interactions with Stories in the Tinkoff App

## Project Overview
This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to analyzing user interactions with stories in the Tinkoff application. These stories, covering a variety of topics from tracking client spending to financial literacy advice, are located at the top of the main screen of the app. Your task is to analyze how clients interact with these stories.

## Task Descriptions
The notebook contains seven tasks of varying complexity, all based on the data of user interactions with stories. Here are some examples:

### Task 1 [5 points]
- **Objective**: Segment app users into age groups with a 5-year interval and identify the most active age group in terms of story reposts.
- **Expected Answer Format**: Age interval; Number of reposts (e.g., `40-45; 1111`)

### Task 2 [5 points]
- **Objective**: Determine who is more likely to 'like' stories: users within the country or outside the country. Calculate the proportion of likes from the total story views.
- **Expected Answer Format**: Group; Percentage of likes (e.g., `outside_country; 20.012`)

## Instructions
1. **Data Analysis**: Each task requires specific data analysis steps. Make sure you understand the data structure and the expected outcomes.
2. **Visualization**: Include visualizations where applicable to support your findings. Visualizations are crucial for understanding data trends and patterns.
3. **Discussion**: Be prepared to discuss your approach, the tools and functions used, and the reasons behind the obtained results. The discussion will be part of the evaluation process.

## Additional Notes
- The notebook includes Python code cells demonstrating how to load data, perform analysis, and visualize results.
- Pay attention to the details in the task descriptions as they guide the expected format and the nature of the analysis.

Good luck with your analysis, and remember to delve deep into the data to uncover insightful trends and patterns!
